Computing normalization of the given power spectrum...

There is in total 2097152 particles (128 particles per dimension).
The box size is 512 Mpc/h.
There are 128 mesh cells per dimension.
The simulation is starting at redshift 200.
The power spectrum 'P(k)=A*k^ns' has amplitude A = 187826 and spectral index ns = 1.
The transfer function 'T(k)=(1 + [ak + (bk)^1.5 + (ck)^2]^v)^(-1/v)'
has coefficients a = 6.4, b = 3, c = 1.7 and v = 1.13.
Smoothing length for TZA was not set. Computing normal ZA.
